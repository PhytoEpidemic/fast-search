In the search box, type the keywords or wildcards you want to include or exclude in your search.
To include a word, simply type it as is.
To exclude a word, add a '-' in front of it (e.g., -cat).
Use Windows search wildcards for more flexibility:
* (asterisk) matches any sequence of characters.
? (question mark) matches any single character.
